# Neovim Configuration

This is a highly modular and organized Neovim configuration, built upon the kickstart.nvim project. It aims to provide a clean, efficient, and extensible development environment.

## Features

- **Modular Structure**: Plugin configurations are organized into functional categories (e.g., `completion`, `debug`, `editor`, `git`, `lang`, `navigation`, `ui`) for better maintainability and readability.
- **Lazy Loading**: Utilizes `lazy.nvim` for efficient plugin management and lazy loading, ensuring fast startup times.
- **Language Support**: Comprehensive support for various programming languages, including Go, Rust, Python, and more, with integrated LSP, linting, and formatting.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved user interface with breadcrumbs, diagnostics viewer, and custom keybinding hints.
- **Development Tools**: Integrated debugging, refactoring, and other development-focused tools.

## Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2.  **Launch Neovim**:
