# Gemini Context for Neovim Configuration

This file serves as a record of modifications and context for the Neovim configuration, specifically for the Gemini CLI agent.

## Initial State

This configuration was initially based on `kickstart.nvim` and had a flat structure for plugin configurations, with each plugin typically residing in its own file under `lua/kickstart/plugins/`.

## Modifications by Gemini (June 27, 2025)

- **Refactoring for Modularity**: The primary goal of this modification was to improve the modularity and organization of the Neovim configuration.
- **New Directory Structure**: Plugin configurations have been reorganized into functional directories under `lua/plugins/`:
    - `lua/plugins/completion/` (e.g., `autopairs.lua`, `cmp.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/debug/` (e.g., `debug.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/editor/` (e.g., `conform.lua`, `mini.lua`, `oil.lua`, `persistance.lua`, `refactor.lua`, `snacks.lua`, `typr.lua`, `wakatime.lua`, `indent_line.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/git/` (e.g., `git.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/lang/` (e.g., `golang.lua`, `leetcode.lua`, `lint.lua`, `lspconfig.lua`, `markdown.lua`, `rust.lua`, `treesitter.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/navigation/` (e.g., `neo-tree.lua`, `telescope.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/ui/` (e.g., `barbecue.lua`, `colorscheme.lua`, `todo-comments.lua`, `trouble.lua`, `tmux.lua`, `which-key.lua`)
- **Autocommands Relocation**: Autocommands previously in `lua/keymaps.lua` have been moved to a dedicated file: `lua/config/autocmds.lua`.
- **`lazy-plugins.lua` Update**: The `lua/lazy-plugins.lua` file has been updated to reflect the new directory structure and load plugins from their new locations.
- **`init.lua` Update**: The `init.lua` file has been updated to include the new `autocmds.lua` file.
- **`README.md` Update**: The `README.md` file has been slightly updated to reflect the improved modularity and organization.

## Future Context

This `GEMINI.md` file is intended to provide a quick overview of the configuration's structure and the changes made by the Gemini agent. It should be kept up-to-date with any significant modifications to the configuration.
