# Gemini Context for Neovim Configuration

This file serves as a record of modifications and context for the Neovim configuration, specifically for the Gemini CLI agent.

## Initial State

This configuration was initially based on `kickstart.nvim` and had a flat structure for plugin configurations, with each plugin typically residing in its own file under `lua/kickstart/plugins/`.

## Modifications by Gemini (June 27, 2025)

- **Refactoring for Modularity**: The primary goal of this modification was to improve the modularity and organization of the Neovim configuration.
- **New Directory Structure**: Plugin configurations have been reorganized into functional directories under `lua/plugins/`:
    - `lua/plugins/completion/` (e.g., `autopairs.lua`, `cmp.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/debug/` (e.g., `debug.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/editor/` (e.g., `conform.lua`, `mini.lua`, `oil.lua`, `persistance.lua`, `refactor.lua`, `snacks.lua`, `typr.lua`, `wakatime.lua`, `indent_line.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/git/` (e.g., `git.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/lang/` (e.g., `golang.lua`, `leetcode.lua`, `lint.lua`, `lspconfig.lua`, `markdown.lua`, `rust.lua`, `treesitter.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/navigation/` (e.g., `neo-tree.lua`, `telescope.lua`)
    - `lua/plugins/ui/` (e.g., `barbecue.lua`, `colorscheme.lua`, `todo-comments.lua`, `trouble.lua`, `tmux.lua`, `which-key.lua`)
- **Autocommands Relocation**: Autocommands previously in `lua/keymaps.lua` have been moved to a dedicated file: `lua/config/autocmds.lua`.
- **`lazy-plugins.lua` Update**: The `lua/lazy-plugins.lua` file has been updated to reflect the new directory structure and load plugins from their new locations.
- **`init.lua` Update**: The `init.lua` file has been updated to include the new `autocmds.lua` file.
- **`README.md` Update**: The `README.md` file has been slightly updated to reflect the improved modularity and organization.

## Future Context

This `GEMINI.md` file is intended to provide a quick overview of the configuration's structure and the changes made by the Gemini agent. It should be kept up-to-date with any significant modifications to the configuration.

## Commit Message Guidelines
```
Short (72 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely).

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too.
- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a
  single space. Use a hanging indent.

### Example for a commit message
```
Add CPU arch filter scheduler support

In a mixed environment of…
```

### A properly formed git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence
If applied, this commit will *\<your subject line here\>*

### Rules for a great git commit message style
* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap lines at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.

### Information in commit messages
* Describe why a change is being made.
* How does it address the issue?
* What effects does the patch have?
* Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was.
* Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.
* Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure.
* The first commit line is the most important.
* Describe any limitations of the current code.
* Do not include patch set-specific comments.

Details for each point and good commit message examples can be found on https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages

### References in commit messages
If the commit refers to an issue, add this information to the commit message header or body. e.g. the GitHub web platform automatically converts issue ids (e.g. #123) to links referring to the related issue. For issues tracker like Jira there are plugins which also converts Jira tickets, e.g. [Jirafy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jirafy/npldkpkhkmpnfhpmeoahhakbgcldplbj).

In header:
```
[#123] Refer to GitHub issue…
```
```
CAT-123 Refer to Jira ticket with project identifier CAT…
```
In body:
```
…
Fixes #123, #124
```
